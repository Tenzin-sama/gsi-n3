        <h2>Innovation</h2>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">Geotech Solutions International believes in creating and applying new
          technologies into effect. With the guidance of experts like Dr. Ranjan K. Dahal and Dr. Manita Timilsina, we
          are working on projects related to the rockfall protection systems, rock slope stability analysis, and
          landslide inventory mapping. Other works in the field of medium to low-cost slope protection techniques useful
          for developing countries are also available through GSI. Some of the innovative techniques are discussed
          below.
          <br><strong>Structure from motion:</strong><br>
          This new technique is a Photogrammetric model useful for 3D visualization of geo-objects and rock slopes. Dr.
          Ranjan K. Dahal and Miss Durga Khatiwada are leading our team to make this research success. The
          photogrammetric model is prepared by taking pictures of a location from different angles overlapping each
          picture that helps in making high-density point cloud.
          <br><strong>Roadside slope stabilization:</strong><br>
          
          In a country like Nepal, road construction is a huge challenge because of the rugged topography of the young
          Himalayan Mountains. Huge excavations are needed to construct roads. Huge excavations always comes to a bigger
          challenge in terms of stability. Slope protection should be considered as prime action in all roads. The
          increasing demand for roads with the increase in the number of vehicles has led us, engineers, to design the
          roads and protect them in an efficient manner. New and old cost-effective technologies are in practice in the
          slope protection work. GSI has been practicing the following methods to stabilize the roadside slope of
          mountainous terrain.<br>
          a) High-Performance Rock Fall Protection System: GSI has started solutions for rockfall protection first time
          in Nepal. We provide a total solution for rockfall protection in Nepal.<br>
          b) Cutting edge technology of Soil Nailing uses grouted, tension-resisting steel elements (nails) installed to
          reinforce the soil. There are varieties of options in this technique to make it cost-effective. Also, it
          depends on the type of geology, climate, and inclination of the slope. GSI can provide the best solutions for
          soil nailing.
          <br><strong>Landslide Inventory Mapping:</strong><br>
          Landslide inventory mapping of whole Nepal is under preparation in GSI. This is a research project of Dr.
          Ranjan Kumar Dahal and GSI is supporting technically.

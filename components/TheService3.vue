        <h2>3. Structural Solutions</h2>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">GSI is involved in the pre-disaster capacity assessment of existing
          structures, post-disaster damage assessment followed by retrofit design implementation for existing structures
          and new design of earthquake-resistant structures via its design center. Moreover; structural engineers and
          geotechnical engineers at GSI are working in collaboration with Ehime University Satellite Office (Kathmandu)
          in the field of earthquake engineering conducting interdisciplinary research, especially after the 2015 Gorkha
          earthquake.

        <h3>1. Microtremor Survey</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Micro-tremor survey of ground and multi-storied buildings for site vs structural response characterization in
          Kathmandu valley, site characterization of Pokhara valley are current studies under the flagship of Ehime
          University Satellite Office. The principal aim of these surveys is to develop seismic micro-zonation maps of
          varying resolutions for various urban and urbanizing areas of Nepal for site based consideration in assessment
          of existing structures as well as in design of new structures.</p>

        <h3>2. Post-Earthquake Assessment</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          In the aftermath of the Gorkha earthquake, as part of the post-earthquake damage assessment, the GSI team
          conducted numerous site studies (commercial services included) focusing on both geotechnical and structural
          aspects of observed damages. These site studies primarily focused around the most notably damaged areas of
          Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI also facilitated early studies on microtremor monitoring at heritage sites (Basantapur Durbar Square,
          Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Changu Narayan, Swayambhunath, Pashupatinath, Sankhu,etc.) with
          international scholars from Kagawa University and Ehime University.</p>

        <h3>3. Performance-Based Capacity Assessment of Existing Structures</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) analysis techniques are applied in evaluating the capacity of
          existing structures –both masonry and reinforced concrete structures. FEMA 356, ATC 40, ASCE 41 and EN
          1998:2004 are followed in absence of clarifying the information in the technical guideline prepared by the
          Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC) Nepal.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Fragility analysis is carried out to quantitatively assess the expected performance of the structure in future
          strong ground motion events. HAZUS MH guideline is followed for the fragility curve generation. Since material
          properties of structural elements play a crucial role in its estimated performance, laboratory testing is
          explicitly carried out for capacity assessment purposes.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          If applicable, capacity assessment results in the need for retrofit intervention for the structure to be code
          compliant for design level performance.</p>

        <h3>4. Retrofit Analysis, Design and Implementation</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Retrofit analysis and design are carried out after the capacity evaluation of damaged structures. Economic
          analysis is carried out prior to retrofit design based on the age of the structure, utility value after the
          retrofit, client’s preference, etc. Once economically justified, the retrofit design is carried out based on
          principles of performance-based design.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          In RC framed structures, FEM based modeling is used in the retrofit design. In the case of masonry structures,
          3MURI® based on EN 1998:2004 is used applying Frame by Macro Element (FME) modeling.</p>

        <h3>5. Earthquake Resistant Design and Analysis of New Structures</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI provides earthquake resistant design using state-of-art numerical software; especially in the analysis and
          design of masonry structures by using Frame by Macro-element (FME) approach of <a href="https://www.stadata.com/en/software-3muri-project/" target="_blank">3MURI®</a> (complaint to the
          provisions of EN:1998:2004).</p>

        <h3>6. Material Testing</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          The material testing laboratory of GSI meets the requirements of ASTM, IS and JGS standards. It can perform a
          variety of concrete and aggregate tests. The major test includes:

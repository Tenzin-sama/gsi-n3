          Environmental impact assessments (EIA) of GSI are custom-designed to meet the specific needs of the client or
          government institutions involved in particular projects. GSI Team has performed assessments for projects
          ranging from limited evaluations of small hydropower projects, bridges, and undeveloped road networks to
          comprehensive assessments of commercial housing projects. It is performed so as to know whether the projects
          cause detrimental effects on the environment.

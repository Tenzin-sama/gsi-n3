        <h3>1. Natural Hazard Mitigation</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI in collaboration with Trumer Schutznbauten GmbH, Austria are implementing rockfall, slope and debris flow
          protection measures in Nepal since 2014. Geohazard related any problems have been dealt with expert opinion
          and solutions are provided according to the site characteristics.
        <ol type="a" class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34 padding-x-32">
          <li><strong>Rockfall Protection Net:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              Rockfall protection systems by Trumer Schutzbauten GmbH consist of an interception structure and a support
              or retaining structure. The interception structure is formed by the Omega-Net with its outstanding
              deformability, flexibility and energy absorption. The support or retaining structure consists of posts,
              bearing ropes, retaining ropes and brake elements.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Slope stabilization:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              The slope retention systems by Trumer Schutzbauten consist of the net or wire netting component, which
              constrains the blocks of rock or unstable material, and the anchors that channel the forces into the
              ground. The coupling of the netting to the anchors is achieved through either spike or clamp plates. As an
              option, support ropes can be attached to the netting and anchors in various configurations, distributing
              forces both vertically and horizontally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Avalanche Protection:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              The avalanche protection systems by Trumer Schutzbauten GmbH utilize the flexible nature and high strength
              of the Omega-Net to prevent avalanches in their first stage of occurrence. Additionally, in scenically
              sensitive areas, the nets are practically transparent and so are an aesthetic alternative to traditional
              snow bridge or snow rack systems.

            <p>GSI, in collaboration with TRUMER Schutzbauten GmbH and Terra Armee, offers solutions for protection from
              geohazards like rockfall, debris flow, shallow landslides, and avalanches. These geohazard mitigation
              services are provided with specialized engineered systems developed and manufactured by Trumer with more
              than two decades of experience.</p>

            <p>The expansion of Trumer protective systems reinforces the worldwide efforts of geologists, engineers, and
              installation teams to safeguard habitats, buildings and infrastructures from natural hazards. The
              protection system can be effortlessly installed and maintained.</p>

            <p>In the case of Nepal, exposure to Geohazards has increased fiercely due to rapid urbanization and a
              growing population. Nepalâ€™s exposure to geohazards can have adverse impacts on residential and commercial
              areas, public facilities, construction sites, mines, coast and river embankments, tourist areas,
              hydropower, roads, irrigation, and railways. For this purpose, new technology and technology transfer is
              the most crucial part of the present scenario in Nepal.
            </p>
            <p>As such, GSI has a suite of solutions to protect from geohazards in the plains of Terai to the Climbing
              trail of Mt Everest. Cost-effective and technically correct solutions and high-quality materials are key
              to our problem-solving approach in Nepal Himalaya.</p>
